This is a an overlay with controller window for windows.
It will let you  play gifs, and sounds at the same time.
These are mappable to elgato stream decks, and will give you an little preview picture of what is assigned.
There are 2 parts, the controller window, where you add interactions, and the actual overlay, which is invisible.
It will trigger in the top left corner of the window, but this is mappable.
The speed is a little funky, so it has to be manually adjusted.

**Known Issues*
This only affects you if you use more than one page of buttons(using the elgato page button)
The next page button is a little quirky on the steam deck.
I do not have a way to poll the current page in the deck, so I've created manual assign buttons.
Create a new page on you deck, and on that blank page, map left and right buttons from the gui.
Within that window, you will then have unlimited pages worth of gif/audio mappings.
You need to pause/hold the overlay if you need to change actual pages on the steam deck.
When you resume, make sure you are back on the main map page.
It's a little buggy and needs some tweaking, but is nearly there.
If anyone can come up with a way to pole the page, I would be much apreciated.

Check out our Game release Balium on steam, and Enjoy the overlay.
